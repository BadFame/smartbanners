    <h1>Web App Install Banner: Related Apps (Android currently) Sample</h1>

    <p>Available in <a href="https://www.chromestatus.com/features/4540065577435136">Chrome 44+ (for Android)</a></p>

    <p>The <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2014/11/Support-for-installable-web-apps-with-webapp-manifest-in-chrome-38-for-Android">related (Native) app install banner</a> will prompt the user to add your web app to the users device.
    It will only prompt when a number of criteria have been met:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>The site is using HTTPS</li>
      <li>The site has a manifest declared</li>
      <li>The manifest has a <code>short_name</code>, 144 pixel icon and a type of 'image/png'</li>
      <li>The manifest has a <code>related_applications</code> section with an object that has the 'type': 'play' and a Google Play Store package ID.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>To see if this example works, come back in another day and you will see the banner.</p>
    <p>For testing we encourage you to force the banner to appear by setting the chrome://flags/#bypass-app-banner-engagement-checks flag.</p>

    <p id='output'></p>

    <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum</p>
    

    <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
